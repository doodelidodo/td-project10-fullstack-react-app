# FullStack React / Node Express App

This is my first FullStack App as my last project for my techdegree @Treehouse.
It shows my skills about React and Express. I tried to use only function in React in combination with Hooks.

### Functionality:
- You can Sign Up / Sign In as a user. 
- Create / Update / Delete - Courses
- only Courses you created can be updated / deleted


### To start the app
- navigate to the api folder
- npm install
- Create the database using `npm run seed`
- `npm start`
- navigate to the client folder
- `npm start`
